                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>What comes about when we are unable to label an individual through the surface? When the visual clues to which we are inured to be decipherable to us, skin color/ Features/ Context, will not volunteer any quick answers? This pain, this hesitation, here is where we start the comprehending.</p>
                <p>This is what Toni Morrison understood when she wrote <em>Recitatif</em> in 1983, and this is a fact that speaks quite loudly in the visual art world even nowadays.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="fade-in">
                <h2>The Power of "Recitatif"</h2>
                <p><em>Recitatif</em> is the only short story ever published by Toni Morrison, and a masterpiece of defying the norm. The story involves two girls, Twyla and Roberta that meet at a children shelter and reunite over their lives over a time span of many decades. In the very first line, Morrison informs us that one of the girls is Black and one is white. But she does not inform us which is which.</p>
                <p>Morrison sets up hints throughout the story that appear clear cut, as time goes on make references to the hair, the culture, the social status but again these hints contradict each other, alter their point and in the end, instead of telling us of the characters being discussed, they disclose more about the assumptions of the reader. We are attempting to solve their races, and we are groping towards stereotypes of which we never knew we have been the possessors.</p>
                <p>This is the genius of Morrison in the form of the mirror which she holds in front of her readers. Having lost the protection of racial names, we must confront Twyla and Roberta as individuals first: more complicated, more sinful, more human. That ambiguity is no sleigh of mouth, it is a challenge to consider the degree to which race influences our perceptions, our sympathies and our judgment.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="fade-in">
                <h2>Mapping the Concept of Uncertainty into Visual Art</h2>
                <p>This challenge is pushed a step higher by visual art. Whereas one can describe without defining in literature, in a painting or illustration something must be depicted; that something is color, form, shadow. But how can you make it racially ambiguous when the medium appears to insist it be precise?</p>
                <p>Fragmentation, abstraction and conscious layering of various truths into one image is the answer, its The Sculpture, A pictorial recitatif.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="fade-in">
                <h2>The Sculpture A Pictorial Recitatif</h2>
                <p>This work represents the challenge that Morrison faces and it is bold and modernist in nature. The head is disjointed, not split asunder, but divided. Two eyes look out on them, though they see things differently, one of the pupils is a plain white point on black, harsh and intense. The other is skirted with picturesque rings of gold and red, implying depth, complication, layers of meaning.</p>
                <p>Its color scheme does not want any easy racial code. There is no hierarchical mixture of mustard gold, terracotta red, cream, and black. Are these skin tones? Shadows? Emotions? Those curly lines that might be locks of hair pass through the picture in black and gold and cream—throwing over everybody and nobody.</p>
                <p>Hands belong to all the face red hands, black hands, touching and blurring, revealing. Whose hands are these? Are they of the figure, or of us, of the beholders, who are endeavouring to seize learning?</p>
                <p>This face belongs to the realm between definitions like in the case of the characters of Morrison. It asks us to realize the way we attempt to place, to categorize and to know automatically. And in the liminal space of indecision, we could find something more real, that identity is too multi-dimensional to be attained at just one look.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="fade-in">
                <h2>Why Does Ambiguity Matter?</h2>
                <p>A world where we continually must pleasure ourselves by drawing boxes and declaring categories will always find ambiguity a form of opposition. It's also an act of humanity. When we are not able to label someone at first, we are made to approach deeper, to listen than administer assumptions, to watch the person and not the label.</p>
                <p>Morrison composed <em>Recitatif</em> at the period when America was experiencing continuous racial conflicts. Decades on, the same tension exists, with the problem being that we are usually stuck within the same lines of assumptions and categorization. Ambiguity in art does not eliminate the difference or does not give an illusion that post-racial world exists. It instead challenges us to remain unsure in such a way as to call into doubt the need of those labels so much to begin with.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="fade-in">
                <h2>The Role of the Viewer</h2>
                <p>What are your responses about this image? What did you think within the first three seconds? and what does that tell you about the messages you internalized as far as race, identity and belonging are concerned?</p>
                <p>These are not pleasant questions. They're not meant to be. Similar to <em>Recitatif</em>, this piece of art does not provide solutions, it just provides a reflection. This is what you make out here as much about yourself as it is about the art.</p>
                <p>And maybe that is the strongest thing that art can do not teach us what to think but show what we are thinking, that we can choose to either continue to think it.</p>

            <section class="fade-in">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Once Toni Morrison said, "Freedom has the role of liberating another person." She liberated her characters of the constraining boxes of racial stereotype in <em>Recitatif</em>, although she was indulging her readers in theirs. This piece of art is a continuation of such project i.e. releasing this image out of one particular meaning of it and asking us to face our desire to know something.</p>
                <p>Between black and white, among the grey we feel, make there place something closer, in the ambiguity which puts us at a loss. One can see each other better and one another.</p>
